# CPP-Appointment-Booking-System (Data Structure Algortihm)

We implemented a singly linked list in this project for displaying, booking, sorting,
searching, and deleting appointments, which are the 5 functions that we implemented for this
project. 

- First, it can display the lists of students who have already booked an appointment with
the counselor. Other than that, this system allows the user to insert a student's information, such
as the student’s name and age, student course, and student matriculation ID.

- The next function is sorting the list of appointments according to the student’s name. 

- The system can sort the list in ascending or descending order by name or age of the students using the
insertion sort method. 

- For the fourth function, the system also allows the user to search for the
students that have already booked the appointments by name.

- Last but not least, the user will beable to delete the appointments that are already booked in the list, as provided by this system.
Users only need to enter the names of students to delete their respective appointments.

- Lastly, there is an external file handling used in order to retrieve and stored each data
contains for a node which will be suitable for handling a huge amount of people per node.

Overall, This project allowed us to apply our knowledge of data structure algorithms and resulted
in a useful and functional system for students and counselors to manage their appointments.
